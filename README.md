# 🚀 FUZZER

## Overview
**FUZZER** is a project for automated testing of software applications by generating unexpected, random, or malformed inputs to identify bugs, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.  
This project is part of a **group project**, where we also built a **mini compiler** as part of the testing targets.  
This tool helps improve software robustness and security by detecting edge-case errors.

## 🗂 Project Files
- `project.l` — Lexer definitions for the mini compiler  
- `project.y` — Parser definitions for the mini compiler  
- `runner.sh` — Script to run fuzzing tests

## ⚡ About AFL++
**AFL++ (American Fuzzy Lop Plus Plus)** is a powerful fuzz testing tool that automatically generates test cases to discover software bugs and security vulnerabilities.  
It uses instrumentation and feedback-guided fuzzing to maximize code coverage and find crashes efficiently.
